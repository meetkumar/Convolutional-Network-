# Convolutional-Network-

This CNN is an image classifier for cats and dogs and at the end of training it will be able to predict if its a cat or dog.

This is the base CNN which can be trained on any images and will be able to detect features from the images to predict content of the image.

Dataset consists of 8000 images in total out of which 50% are dogs and 50% are cats, also images are labeled in different folders.

Single prediction folder consists of image of dog and cat but they aren't labeled, because we want CNN to prdict whether its a dog or cat.
